# VOS - Virtual Office Secretary
Missouri S&T ECE Department - Senior Design 2

Virtual Office Secretary (VOS) gives university professors and students a streamlined communication interface. A touchscreen tablet (running on a Raspberry Pi4) mounted outside the professor's office displays their current availability, office hours, and a display message. VOS also provides students with a two-way communication interface to send messages directly to the professor's phone. The professor can update all of the VOS display data and communicate with students from their Android phone using the VOS mobile app anywhere they have internet access.
